Web development is the process of creating and maintaining websites and web applications, combining design, coding, and content management.
It's essential because it enables businesses and individuals to establish an online presence, provides easy access to information, supports user engagement, 
facilitates e-commerce, and builds brand credibility.


HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. Its primary purpose in web development is to structure content on the web. HTML provides the foundational framework for web pages
 by defining elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other content.


CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. In web development, CSS is used to style and layout web pages. It controls the visual presentation of HTML elements, including colors,
 fonts, spacing, alignment, and responsiveness.


JavaScript is a programming language used to create interactive and dynamic website elements. Unlike HTML and CSS, which handle structure and styling,
 JavaScript enables functionality, such as responding to user actions (clicks, form submissions, etc.), updating content without reloading the page, and creating animations.
  It’s crucial for building interactive websites because it enhances user experience, making web pages more engaging, responsive, and capable of performing complex tasks.


React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. 
It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the user interface efficiently by updating only the parts of the page that need changes.


Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side. It’s commonly used for building scalable, fast, and efficient server-side 
applications and APIs.


I aim to understand these skills deeply so I can build efficient, interactive websites and applications for everyday use. I believe if I acquire these skills, 
I will be able to provide solutions to many problems in the African continent and worldwide.
